Officials notes about NGUI 2 cycle 
==================

"NGUI 2.7.0, the last of NGUI 2 cycle is now free and can be downloaded here (www.tasharen.com). It’s dated September 2012, and comes in full source code form and without any kind of DRM. It’s feature-limited and not nearly as streamlined as the current NGUI 3-based releases, and doesn’t come with support — but if you can’t afford NGUI 3 or just want to try it, you’re welcome to grab it."

> NGUI270Revive fall under theses conditions too:

"Just note that in order to use it for professional purposes you must fall under the same conditions as Unity Free: “free version may not be licensed by a commercial entity with annual gross revenues (based on fiscal year) in excess of US$100,000, or by an educational, non-profit or government entity with an annual budget of over US$100,000.”"
